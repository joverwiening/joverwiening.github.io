## Research Experience

### Research in computational neuroscience and machine learning (2024--today)
**Topic:** *The multi-layer tempotron: towards deep biological learning.*  
**Supervisor:** Haim Sompolinsky, Harvard University, United States

Built a deep spiking neural network with a biologically plausible learning rule, called the multi-layer tempotron. Learning is done without gradient descent and with local spike-time dependent error amplitudes. The model performs close to multi-layer perceptrons on standard datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10) and outperforms them on invariant datasets (ETH80). Submitted to COSYNE 2025.

### Master thesis in physics and computational neuroscience (2023--2024)
**Title:** *A biologically realistic Mean-Field model of the Thalamus.* (Grade: 1.0)  
**Supervisors:** Alain Destexhe (NeuroPSI, CNRS, France), Svetlana Gurevich (ITP, Germany)

Modeled the thalamus with a mean-field model of spiking networks, which incorporates detailed single-cell parameters linked to neuromodulators and measurable electrophysiological data. Reproduced significant thalamic single-cell experiments and showed their effect at the population level. Provided new insight into thalamic state-dependent responsiveness and spindle generation. First paper accepted at PLOS CB. Second paper submitted.

### Research in applied maths for neuroscience (2022--today)
**Topic:** *Modeling human fMRI, MEG, and default mode network dynamics.*  
**Supervisors:** Oliver Kamps, Tim Hahn (CENOS and OCC, Münster, Germany)

Modeled the time behaviour of human fMRI and MEG data using nonlinear physics and machine learning tools. Found that the default mode network can be described with Lotka-Volterra type ODEs, and that there is close to clinical-level accuracy of differences in the topography between healthy patients and patients with major depressive disorder (N=1800). First paper in draft.

### Bachelor thesis in theoretical particle physics (2021)
**Title:** *Neutralino-Gluino Coannihilation in the MSSM.* (Grade: 1.0)  
**Supervisors:** Karol Kovařík, Michael Klasen (ITP, University of Münster, Germany)

Introduced a phenomenological minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) where a bino-wino like neutralino fulfils the role of the sole dark matter particle. Analytically calculated and numerically computed the neutralino's relic density and validated with experiments. Code included in [DM@NLO](https://dmnlo.hepforge.org/).
