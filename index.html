<h1>Welcome</h1>

<p>Welcome to my personal website:) </p>


<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>I am a Physics PhD student at the Kempner Insitute at Harvard. My research is trying to advance our understanding how learning and intelligence arises in the brain and in artificial networks and if we can find quantitative theories for these systems.</p>

<p>When I'm not working on research, I enjoy photography, climbing, boardgames, and writing.</p>
